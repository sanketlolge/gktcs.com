<p class="style1">Today most of educational organization lack in availability of quality trainers which are up-skilled as per the current IT industry. Situation becomes worse in remote areas. Also the university curriculum is not always well designed as per the industry needs. There comes the need for the campus training requirement from any reputed organization like GKTCS.</p>

<p class="style1">Capsule training programs which are specially designed by GKTCS considering the industry needs and time constrains of the educational organization. Even though these programs are specially designed as finishing school programs, our plan starts right from first year. These programs are conducted at campus with the help of expert industry trainers. These Industry readiness programs cover technical trainings and interview preparation workshops including soft skill trainings. These programs are very moderately charged as compared to any retails training programs conducted at the centre. At the end of the programs students are given industry oriented certificates and opportunity for 100% Placement Assistance.</p>
